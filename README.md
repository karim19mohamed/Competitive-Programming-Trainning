# Competitive Programming Trainings:

This repository contains all the codes, contests and trainings that I went through my competitive programming journey. 

## My Toolbox:

I have created my own toolbox that I uses in any contest. They are like black-box codes that I uses in any contest. This toolbox includes:

- [Algorithms General](https://github.com/karim19mohamed/Competitive-Programming-Trainning/tree/master/Algorithms%20General)

  This folder contains:
  - Binary search using two patterns (TTTTTTFFFFFF, FFFFFFFFFTTTT).
  - Knapsack with dynamic programming and printing the selecting items.
  - Merge sort.

- [Algorithms Geometry](https://github.com/karim19mohamed/Competitive-Programming-Trainning/tree/master/Algorithms%20Geometry)

  This folder contains:
  - find if a point on segment or not
  - orientation of three points
  - find if 2 segments intersect or not
  - find intersection of 2 segments
